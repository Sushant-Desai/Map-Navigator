This is a simple map navigator program written in Java. It allows you to navigate between different cities, finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features

- Graph Representation: The cities and roads are represented as a graph.
- Shortest Path Calculation: Calculates the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.
